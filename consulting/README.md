## Mission statement

Our mission is to bootstrap your multimedia applications on all platforms.

We achieve this through our state of the art application kit called Sky kit along with our
practical experience on the field for more than 10 years.

## We build powerful applications

In the last few years, we've been revamping the most popular video player, used by millions: VLC
media player. We're specialized in application production covering mainstream multimedia use cases
all the way to the most advanced streaming technologies with applications like MotionMonkey or
tevolution. 

We make it powerful and we make it beautiful: from the first line to the last pixel.

## We rely on state of the art technology

[Sky kit](https://omega.gg/Sky/sources) is a comprehensive and open source application kit
specifically built for high performance multimedia applications. It's based on the Qt framework
and comes with an integrated VLC streaming engine.

It supports 5 platforms from a single C / C++ / QML codebase and provides dynamic UX / UI while
adapting to the different hardware and interactions. It's a solid technical proposition that
retains a strong versatility.

Given its multimedia parti pris it makes application production efficient while scaling beautifully
on each platform. It produces native and multiplatform applications from a single codebase: there's
currently no equivalent to this in the multimedia field.

Supported libraries: Qt5 and Qt6, libVLC 3.x and libVLC 4.x

## We deploy everywhere from a single codebase

Application development is nothing if you can't succesfully deploy on each platform you're
targeting. We ensure that everything looks great no matter where it runs and automate the
deployment process through an Azure based continuous integration. We hold your hand until the
application runs on concrete hardware inside your very own hands.

Supported platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Apple TV, Android TV

## We publish your application on all major marketplaces

Deploying is not enough, you need to reach the gates of the different marketplaces. That's not an
easy task when it comes to streaming applications but we know our ways to succesful multimedia
application publishing. When we deliver an application it will be published for testers and ready
to publish for everyone.

Supported marketplaces: Microsoft store, Apple App Store, Google Play, Steam, itch.io
